       "' Flutter is an open-source mobile application development framework created by Google. It is used to build natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. Flutter uses the Dart programming language and provides a fast development, testing, and deployment experience with a rich set of widgets and libraries. It is known for its reactive UI, expressive and flexible UI toolkit, and the ability to deliver high-performance apps. Flutter compiles the code to native ARM machine code, which results in fast and smooth app performance.'"
